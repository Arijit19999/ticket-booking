## ✨ Features

### Venue Layout & Seat Map

- **121 seats** across 10 rows, organized into 3 pricing tiers
- Color-coded visual grid — VIP (gold), Premium (blue), General (green)
- Row labels, stage indicator, and real-time availability counters per tier
- Hover tooltips showing seat details (row, number, tier, price)

### Concurrency Simulation

- Background interval fires **every 5 seconds**, randomly marking 1–2 available seats as unavailable
- Simulates real-world behavior of other users purchasing tickets simultaneously
- Pauses automatically during checkout to prevent mid-transaction conflicts

### Reservation Timer

- **5-minute countdown** begins when the first seat is selected
- Circular SVG progress ring with color transitions:
  - 🟣 Indigo → normal
  - 🟡 Amber → under 2 minutes
  - 🔴 Red + pulse animation → under 1 minute
- Auto-releases all held seats back to the pool when timer expires

### Conflict Resolution

Three conflict scenarios handled:

| Scenario                             | Behavior                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Click on an already-taken seat       | Rejected immediately with toast notification                         |
| Interval takes a seat you selected   | Removed from cart + error toast                                      |
| Click at exact moment interval fires | JS single-threaded guarantee — guard checks status at execution time |

### Checkout Flow

- Mock API with **1.5 second** simulated network delay
- **20% random failure rate** to simulate server errors
- On success → confirmation modal with booking ID
- On failure → error toast, seats remain selected for retry
- Loading spinner on button during processing

### UI/UX Polish

- Dark theme with glassmorphism-inspired surfaces
- Smooth CSS transitions on all seat state changes
- Animated cart items (fade-in-up on add)
- Responsive layout — two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Toast notifications for every user-facing event (Sonner)
- Sticky cart sidebar and header

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

### Why Zustand over Redux/Context?

Zustand provides a minimal API with built-in selector-based re-rendering. Since this app has **high-frequency state updates** (timer ticking every second, interval every 5 seconds, seat clicks), Zustand's granular subscriptions prevent unnecessary re-renders. Components only re-render when their specific slice of state changes.

### Why `Map<string, Seat>` over an Array?

Seat lookups happen on every click and every interval tick. A `Map` gives **O(1)** access by seat ID, which is critical for conflict resolution — we need to check a seat's current status _at the exact moment_ of interaction, not after iterating through an array.

### How Conflict Resolution Works

JavaScript is single-threaded. The concurrency interval and user clicks both modify the same Zustand store synchronously. When a user clicks a seat:

```
1. selectSeat(seatId) is called
2. It reads seat.status from the Map RIGHT NOW
3. If status !== "available" → return false (conflict!)
4. If status === "available" → proceed with selection
```

This **guard-first pattern** ensures that even if the interval marked the seat unavailable one millisecond before the click handler executed, the click will see the updated status and reject gracefully.

### Why `useRef` for Checkout Flag?

The concurrency interval runs in a `useEffect` closure. To read the latest `isCheckingOut` value without re-creating the interval, we sync it to a ref. This avoids clearing and re-setting the interval on every checkout state change.

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

Use these to manually verify all requirements:

| #   | Test                                          | Expected Result                                     |
| --- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Click an available seat                       | Seat turns indigo, appears in cart, timer starts    |
| 2   | Click a selected seat                         | Seat reverts to tier color, removed from cart       |
| 3   | Wait 5 seconds                                | 1–2 random seats turn gray (concurrency simulation) |
| 4   | Wait for interval to take your selected seat  | Toast: "Seat X was just taken!", removed from cart  |
| 5   | Click a gray/unavailable seat                 | Toast: "Seat X is no longer available!"             |
| 6   | Select seats → wait 5 minutes                 | Timer expires, all seats released, cart cleared     |
| 7   | Select seats → click Checkout → success (80%) | Confirmation modal with booking ID                  |
| 8   | Select seats → click Checkout → failure (20%) | Error toast, seats remain selected for retry        |
| 9   | Resize to mobile                              | Layout stacks vertically, seats remain clickable    |
| 10  | Rapid double-click same seat                  | No duplicate entries in cart                        |

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

| Viewport        | Layout                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `≥ 1024px` (lg) | Two-column — seat map left, sticky cart right |
| `< 1024px`      | Single column — seat map stacked above cart   |
| `< 640px` (sm)  | Compact seat cells (28px), tighter gaps       |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] WebSocket integration for real multi-user concurrency
- [ ] Seat category filters (show only VIP, hide sold out)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (arrow keys to traverse grid, Enter to select)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
- [ ] Unit tests with Vitest + React Testing Library
